Anyone may feel free to contribute by reveiwing and debugging this extension, especially raising the problems encountered in "issue" page.

Currently, there are no plans to extend the content of this extension, unless some more popular IoT service platforms arise.

I am not planning to develop any function related to Blynk. It works like another "firmware" on the makeblock products, and using such platform without writing any arduino code will be not practical.

Please feel free to report any bugs and give any suggestions. We may discuss more on how to make this extension better.

Good day!
